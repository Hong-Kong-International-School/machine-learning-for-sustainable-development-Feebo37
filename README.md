# System Details: 
The SDG I will be focusing on is SDG 3 (Health and Well-Being), more specifically I will be building a model that will detect skin cancer using image classification. You would input a picture of your skin and the ai will output whether you have a benign tumor or a malignant tumor.
    
## Required tools
 
Computer
My model file (Link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-txzIhAyZEoO2JMX6YIheJgUgGBpISyS/view?usp=drive_link)
    
    
    
## What does the system do
   
 The system is supposed to read uploaded images of possible skin cancer spots and tell you whether it is a malignant tumor or a benign tumor.
     
    
    
## How to install the system
    
 Download the file and then you can do what you want with my model. For example, you can upload to cloud service and use it from there.   
   
    
# Model Details:
This model was trained using transfer learning, on resnet-50.   
This model was trained for 50 epochs with batch size of 7.

## Data Source   
   Link to dataset(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ur7Jnzo0mu6vTZh3zdQq-b0jBI2vBgjJ?usp=drive_link) 
    
## Model Performance
    
    Not tested yet, with the training it was averaging 85-95% accuracy.
    
 
## Stages of Development

 I started with just my goal of finding a way to detect skin cancer using uploaded images, but I realised that it would be very difficult to do, due to time constraints. I plan on working on this in my own time and finishing it.
    
   
## Future Work
   -Deployed so It can be used withen the frontend application.
        -Some options that could work (Package model with core ML and deploy directly into the Device)
            - Talk about pros and cons of that
    -Deploy model as a cloud service (Azure, Hiroku, etc)
    -Providing Accese Via a REST API
